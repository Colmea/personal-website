import TestComponent from '../../../src/components/testComponent.jsx';

This is my first post.

##### Javascript code:
```javascript
// This is a comment
const myVar = myApp.getConfig('title');

myVar.forEach(myVar => {
    console.log('plop');
});
```

And this is a React component:

<TestComponent />
